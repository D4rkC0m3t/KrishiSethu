## ðŸš¨ Critical Security Configurations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Update Supabase RLS Policies**
   ```sql
   -- Verify these policies are active
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';
   ```

2. **Configure Production Environment**
   ```bash
   # Set secure environment variables
   REACT_APP_ENABLE_HTTPS=true
   REACT_APP_SECURE_COOKIES=true
   ```

3. **Test Authentication Flow**
   - Registration with trial period
   - Login with trial status check
   - Admin access restrictions
   - Account suspension for expired trials

4. **Verify Data Access**
   - Users can only access their own data
   - Admin can access all data
   - Proper error handling for unauthorized access

## ðŸ”§ Security Testing Commands

### Test Database Security
```bash
# Run database verification
node verify-database.js

# Test RLS policies
npm run test:security
```

### Test Application Security
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Security scan
npm run security:scan
```

## ðŸ“‹ Pre-Deployment Security Verification

### Final Security Checks:
1. **Authentication System**
   - [ ] User registration creates 30-day trial
   - [ ] Login checks trial status
   - [ ] Expired accounts are suspended
   - [ ] Admin controls work properly

2. **Data Protection**
   - [ ] User data is isolated
   - [ ] Sensitive information is encrypted
   - [ ] API endpoints are secured
   - [ ] Input validation prevents attacks

3. **Network Security**
   - [ ] HTTPS is enforced
   - [ ] CORS is properly configured
   - [ ] Security headers are present
   - [ ] CSP is implemented

4. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Error tracking is active
   - [ ] Security events are logged
   - [ ] Performance is monitored
   - [ ] Alerts are configured

## ðŸš€ Post-Deployment Security Tasks

### Immediate (Day 1):
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate is working
- [ ] Test all authentication flows
- [ ] Monitor error logs for issues
- [ ] Verify backup systems are running

### Short-term (Week 1):
- [ ] Review security logs
- [ ] Test incident response procedures
- [ ] Verify monitoring alerts
- [ ] Conduct security scan

### Ongoing:
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Monthly security reviews
- [ ] Quarterly penetration testing
- [ ] Annual security audit
