# 🏪 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
## Krishisethu Inventory Management System

### 🚨 CRITICAL: First-Time Setup (Do This BEFORE Users Register)

#### Step 1: Create Admin User
```bash
# Run this command to create the first admin user
node create-admin-simple.js
```

**Default Admin Credentials:**
- Email: `admin@krishisethu.com`
- Password: `admin123`
- Role: `admin`

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Change these credentials immediately after first login!

#### Step 2: Deploy to Production
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to your hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
# Make sure to set environment variables if needed
```

#### Step 3: Configure Firebase for Production
1. **Update Firebase Security Rules** (if needed)
2. **Set up proper domain authentication**
3. **Configure email verification** (optional)

### 👥 USER REGISTRATION WORKFLOW

#### For Shop Owners/Managers:
1. **Admin creates accounts** via User Management panel
2. **No self-registration** for security
3. **Role-based access control**

#### User Roles:
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management
- **Manager**: Inventory, sales, reports, limited user management  
- **Staff**: Basic operations, customer management

---

### 🔐 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

#### Authentication:
- ✅ Firebase Authentication (secure)
- ✅ Role-based permissions
- ✅ Firestore security rules
- ⚠️ Change default admin password
- ⚠️ Use strong passwords for all users

#### Data Protection:
- ✅ Firestore security rules active
- ✅ User data encrypted
- ⚠️ Regular backups recommended
- ⚠️ Monitor user activity

---

### 📱 USER ONBOARDING PROCESS

#### When a shop wants to use the system:

1. **Contact Admin** (you) to request access
2. **Admin creates user account** with appropriate role
3. **User receives login credentials** 
4. **User logs in and changes password**
5. **Admin provides training/documentation**

### 🛠️ COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS

#### Issue 1: "User not found"
**Solution**: Admin needs to create user account first

#### Issue 2: "Permission denied"
**Solution**: Check user role and permissions in User Management

#### Issue 3: "Cannot access features"
**Solution**: Verify user role matches required permissions

#### Issue 4: "Login fails"
**Solution**: Check email/password, ensure account is active
