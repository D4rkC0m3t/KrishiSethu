-- TEST PRODUCTS TABLE ACCESS AFTER RLS FIXES
-- ============================================================================

-- 1. Check if products table exists
SELECT

    '' as spacer;

SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,

-- 5. Test basic products table access
SELECT

    '' as spacer;

-- Count products (should work regardless of content)
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_products,

-- Check suppliers table
