-- ============================================================================
-- üîí STORAGE POLICIES FIX - For Existing Buckets
-- ============================================================================
-- This script only fixes RLS policies since buckets already exist
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- ============================================================================

-- 1. Enable RLS on storage.objects (if not already enabled)
ALTER TABLE storage.objects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Drop all existing policies to start fresh (ignore errors if they don't exist)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated uploads for product-images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public reads for product-images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated updates for product-images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated deletes for product-images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public Access for Product Images" ON storage.objects;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated uploads for product-documents" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public reads for product-documents" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated updates for product-documents" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated deletes for product-documents" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public Access for Product Documents" ON storage.objects;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated uploads for pos-images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public reads for pos-images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated updates for pos-images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated deletes for pos-images" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public Access for POS Images" ON storage.objects;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated uploads for pos-documents" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public reads for pos-documents" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated updates for pos-documents" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated deletes for pos-documents" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public Access for POS Documents" ON storage.objects;

-- Drop any other generic policies that might conflict
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can upload an avatar." ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Avatar images are publicly accessible." ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow logged in users to upload." ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access." ON storage.objects;

-- 3. Create comprehensive storage policies for product_images bucket
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads for product_images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'product_images');

CREATE POLICY "Allow public reads for product_images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT 
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'product_images');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated updates for product_images" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'product_images')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'product_images');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated deletes for product_images" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE 
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'product_images');

-- 4. Create policies for product_documents bucket
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads for product_documents" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'product_documents');

CREATE POLICY "Allow public reads for product_documents" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT 
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'product_documents');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated updates for product_documents" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'product_documents')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'product_documents');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated deletes for product_documents" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE 
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'product_documents');

-- 5. Create policies for pos_images bucket
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads for pos_images" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'pos_images');

CREATE POLICY "Allow public reads for pos_images" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT 
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'pos_images');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated updates for pos_images" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'pos_images')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'pos_images');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated deletes for pos_images" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE 
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'pos_images');

-- 6. Create policies for pos_documents bucket
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads for pos_documents" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'pos_documents');

CREATE POLICY "Allow public reads for pos_documents" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT 
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'pos_documents');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated updates for pos_documents" ON storage.objects
FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'pos_documents')
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'pos_documents');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated deletes for pos_documents" ON storage.objects
FOR DELETE 
TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'pos_documents');

-- 7. Verify the setup
