# 🏢 Multi-Tenant Architecture Overview

## 🎯 **WHAT IS MULTI-TENANCY?**

Your KrishiSethu system now supports **multiple organizations** (businesses) on a single platform with **complete data isolation**. Each organization has their own:
- Users & permissions
- Products & inventory  
- Orders & customers
- Settings & configurations

**Think SaaS platforms like Shopify, Slack, or Notion** - one system, many businesses.

---

## 🔒 **COMPLETE DATA ISOLATION**

### **Organization-Level Separation**
- ✅ **Organization A** cannot see **Organization B's** data
- ✅ Users belong to ONE organization only
- ✅ All queries are automatically filtered by organization
- ✅ Zero risk of data leaks between tenants

### **Database Security**
```sql
-- Example: Every query automatically includes organization filter
SELECT * FROM products WHERE organization_id = current_user_org();
```

---

## 👥 **USER ROLES & PERMISSIONS**

### **Role Hierarchy** (per organization)
1. **Owner** - Full control of organization
2. **Admin** - User management + all features
3. **Manager** - Advanced inventory operations
4. **Staff** - Basic inventory operations

### **Permissions Matrix**
| Feature | Owner | Admin | Manager | Staff |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|-------|
| Organization settings | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| User management | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Delete data | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Purchase orders | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Products & inventory | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sales orders | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## 📊 **SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT**

### **Built-in Limits**
Each organization has limits based on their plan:

| Plan | Users | Products | Storage | Price |
|------|-------|----------|---------|-------|
| **Free** | 3 | 50 | 100MB | $0 |
| **Starter** | 10 | 500 | 1GB | $29/mo |
| **Business** | 50 | 5,000 | 10GB | $99/mo |
| **Enterprise** | Unlimited | Unlimited | 100GB | $299/mo |

## 🛠️ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Database Schema**
```sql
-- Every business table has organization_id
CREATE TABLE products (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id) NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  -- ... other fields
);
```

### **Row Level Security**
```sql
-- Users can only see their organization's data
CREATE POLICY "org_isolation" ON products
  FOR ALL USING (organization_id = get_user_organization());
```

### **Application Logic**
```javascript
// All queries automatically include organization context
const products = await supabase
  .from('products')
  .select('*') // organization filter applied automatically
```

---

## 🎯 **USE CASES**

### **Perfect For:**
- **Multiple business locations** (franchises)
- **White-label solutions** (reseller model)
- **Agency management** (multiple client accounts)
- **Department separation** (large organizations)

### **Example Scenarios:**
1. **Agricultural Cooperative** - Each farmer/member has separate inventory
2. **Retail Chain** - Each store location isolated
3. **Software Reseller** - Each client gets their own instance
4. **Manufacturing** - Each product line/division separated

---

## 🔄 **UPGRADE PATH**

Your current single-tenant system can easily **upgrade to multi-tenant**:

1. ✅ **Database ready** - schema supports both modes
2. ✅ **UI compatible** - existing interface works
3. ✅ **Migration friendly** - existing data can be moved to organizations
4. ✅ **Optional feature** - can start single-tenant, upgrade later
