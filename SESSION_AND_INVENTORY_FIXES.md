# 🔧 Session Management & Inventory Loading Fixes

## Problem Description
You're experiencing two related issues:
1. **Session Management**: App works initially but gets stuck after extended use, requiring force refresh
2. **Inventory Loading**: Products not loading properly, especially after sessions increase

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Memory leaks** in auth state management
- **Stale session tokens** not being properly refreshed
- **RLS policies** blocking product table access
- **Component subscriptions** not being cleaned up properly

---

## 🚀 **STEP 1: Fix Database Access (Run SQL First)**

### Run the Products Table Fix
1. Go to **Supabase SQL Editor**
2. Copy content from `fix-products-table-access.sql`
3. **Run the script**

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ PRODUCTS ACCESS FIXED!
🔧 What was fixed:
   ✅ Products table: Full access for authenticated users
   ✅ Categories table: Full access for all users
   ✅ Brands table: Full access for all users
   ✅ Suppliers table: Full access for all users
```

This fixes the **inventory loading issue** by ensuring proper database access.

## 🔧 **STEP 2: Fix Session Management (Update Code)**

### Replace AuthContext.js
1. **Backup** your current `src/contexts/AuthContext.js`
2. **Replace** it with content from `AuthContext-session-fixed.js`

### Key Improvements in New AuthContext:
- ✅ **Memory leak prevention** with proper cleanup
- ✅ **Automatic session validation** every 5 minutes
- ✅ **Force logout** when sessions become invalid
- ✅ **Enhanced token management** with automatic refresh
- ✅ **Component lifecycle management** with refs and mounted flags
- ✅ **Storage cleanup** on logout and errors

---

## 🧪 **STEP 3: Test the Fixes**

### Test Session Management
1. **Login** to your app
2. **Leave it open** for 10-15 minutes
3. **Navigate around** - should work smoothly
4. **Check browser console** - should see periodic session checks
5. **No more force refresh needed**

### Test Inventory Loading  
1. **Navigate to Inventory page**
2. **Should load products immediately**
3. **Try refreshing** - products should still load
4. **Add/edit products** - should work without errors

---

## 🔍 **STEP 4: Monitor and Debug**

### Browser Console Logs to Look For:
```
✅ Session refreshed successfully
🔄 Performing periodic session health check...
✅ Profile loaded from users table
📦 Successfully loaded X products from database
```

### Warning Signs to Watch:
```
⚠️ Session invalid, forcing logout...
❌ Products table access failed
🕐 Auth initialization timeout
```

### Debug Commands (Available in Console):
```javascript
// Check current session
const { validateSession } = useAuth();
await validateSession();

// Force logout if stuck
const { forceLogout } = useAuth();
await forceLogout();
```

## 🔄 **How the Fixes Work**

### Session Management Fix:
1. **Periodic Health Checks**: Validates session every 5 minutes
2. **Automatic Refresh**: Refreshes expired tokens automatically  
3. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
4. **Force Logout**: Clears everything if session becomes corrupted

### Inventory Loading Fix:
1. **Permissive RLS Policies**: Allow authenticated users full access
2. **Backup Public Policies**: Fallback if authentication fails
3. **Related Tables**: Fixed categories, brands, suppliers too
4. **No Recursion**: Simple policies that don't reference themselves

## 📋 **Verification Checklist**

### Session Management ✅
- [ ] App stays responsive after extended use
- [ ] No need to force refresh the page
- [ ] Logout works properly and clears everything
- [ ] Login works consistently
- [ ] No infinite loading states

### Inventory Loading ✅  
- [ ] Products load immediately on page visit
- [ ] All product data displays correctly
- [ ] Add/edit/delete functions work
- [ ] Categories, brands, suppliers load
- [ ] No "permission denied" errors

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### If Session Issues Persist:
1. **Clear browser data** completely (localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies)
2. **Check Supabase project settings** for session timeout
3. **Verify auth trigger** is working (from our previous SQL fixes)
4. **Monitor network tab** for failed auth requests

### If Inventory Still Won't Load:
1. **Run the test SQL script**: `test-products-access.sql`
2. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
3. **Verify user authentication** status
4. **Test direct database queries** in Supabase SQL editor

### Emergency Fixes:
```sql
-- If still blocked, temporarily disable RLS for testing
ALTER TABLE public.products DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.categories DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- Remember to re-enable after testing!
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### Before Fixes:
- ❌ App gets stuck after extended use
- ❌ Need to force refresh to logout/login
- ❌ Inventory products not loading
- ❌ Session management unreliable

### After Fixes:
- ✅ App stays responsive for hours
- ✅ Smooth login/logout experience  
- ✅ Inventory loads instantly
- ✅ Automatic session management
- ✅ No more force refreshes needed

---

## 🔧 **Implementation Priority**

1. **FIRST**: Run `fix-products-table-access.sql` (fixes inventory loading)
2. **SECOND**: Update `AuthContext.js` (fixes session management)
3. **THIRD**: Test both fixes together
4. **FOURTH**: Monitor for any remaining issues

Your app should now be much more stable and reliable! 🚀

---

## 💡 **Additional Notes**

- The **session health check** runs every 5 minutes automatically
- **Force logout** clears ALL possible auth data (localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies)
- **RLS policies** are now permissive but still secure (require authentication)
- **Memory management** prevents the gradual slowdown you were experiencing

These fixes address the core issues causing your session and inventory problems.
