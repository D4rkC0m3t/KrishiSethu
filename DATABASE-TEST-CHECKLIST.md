## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Connection Timeouts**: Check Supabase connection limits
2. **RLS Policy Errors**: Verify user permissions
3. **Foreign Key Violations**: Check data relationships
4. **Performance Issues**: Review query plans and indexes

### Debug Commands
```sql
-- Check active connections
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;

-- Check table sizes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) 
FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Check slow queries
SELECT query, mean_time, calls FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY mean_time DESC LIMIT 10;
```
